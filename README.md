# LogisticRegression_DataAnalysis
My notebooks files where I use the logistic regression model to make some predictions on a few data sets. Data provided by Kaggle, and project provided by Jose Portilla.

The first data set is the Titanic data set. For this data, I filled in missing data and trained a logistic regression model to predict a passenger's survival. 

The second data set is an advertisement engagement data set. I cleaned the data set, visualized and analyzed the relationships in the data, and then I trained a model to predict two categorical features: if a user is male or female, and if a user clicked on an ad. I also consider which model proved to be more accurate.
