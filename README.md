# LogisticRegression_Notes
My notebooks files where I use the logisitic regression model to make some predictions on a few data sets. Data provided by Kaggle, and project provided by Jose Portilla.

The first data set is the Titanic data set. I filled in missing data, and trained a logistic regression model to predict survival. The second data set is an advertisement analysis data set, from which I visualize the data and train a model to predict if a user is male, or if a user clicked on an ad.
